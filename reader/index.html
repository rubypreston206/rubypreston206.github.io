            MEME REPLICATION: THE MEMETIC LIFE-CYCLE 
        </div>

        <div class="subtitle">
            the memetic life-cycle consists of 4 stages that together determine the meme's fitness: assimilation, retention, expression and transmission
        </div>
      

        

        <div class="text">
        To be replicated, a meme must pass successfully through four subsequent stages: 1) assimilation by an individual, who thereby becomes a host of the meme; 2) retention in that individual's memory; 3) expression by the individual in language, behavior or another form that can be perceived by others; 4) transmission of the thus created message or meme vehicle to one or more other individuals. This last stage is followed again by stage 1, thus closing the replication loop. At each stage there is selection, meaning that some memes will be eliminated. Let us look in more detail at the mechanisms governing these four stages.
